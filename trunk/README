This is a testbed for testing the security of HTML
sanitization programs.

A HTML sanitization program is one that takes a HTML document
and tries to remove all active content (e.g., all Javascript,
Flash, Java, etc.) as well as filtering out all other potentially
harmless stuff.

This testbed contains a bunch of test cases, as well as some
Javascript that runs in your browser to try to autodetect whether
any of those test cases managed to fool the HTML sanitizer.  A
testcase is listed as failing if it looks like that testcase
may have uncovered a security breach in the HTML sanitizer.

To use this testsuite:
1. For each file matching testcases/t*.html, run your HTML
sanitizer on that file (replacing the original file with your
sanitized version).
2. Start up Firefox.
3. Install Firebug.
4. Enable Firebug's console and script debugger (for the site
you'll load the file from, in step 5).
5. Load testbed.html in your browser -- e.g., using file://path/to/testbed.html.
Firefox should pause for a long time (around 45-60 seconds), then
produce a ton of output on the Firebug console window.
6. Did any alert boxes pop up?  If so, there's definitely a hole
in your HTML sanitizer -- script got executed.
7. Look through the copious output on the Firebug console window.
Did any tests fail?  If so, that indicates that my scripts found
something suspicious which indicates that something bad *might* have
gotten through the HTML filter -- but you'll have to examine the
HTML sanitizer's output manually to check.  Examine the output
on the Firebug console window for clues about what looked suspicious,
and examine the HTML document prodcued by the HTML sanitizer, and
try to understand whether this is dangerous or not.  (If necessary,
you could load that document on a few different browsers to see
if any of them exhibit dangerous behavior.)  You may experience some
false positives -- my testing scripts are biased towards producing
"fail"s if in doubt.


This was tested with Firefox 3.6.23 and Firebug 1.7.3.
I haven't tested it with any other browser; I make no claims about
portability -- it might work with other browsers, but it might not.

It's possible this might work without Firebug (I didn't test it),
but you'll get less detailed output about failing tests and other
debugging information, so I highly recommend installing Firebug.

This suite comes with no support.  If it works for you, great!
If it doesn't, you're on your own.
